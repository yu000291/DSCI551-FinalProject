    <b>Web Page Introduction:</b>
    <p>We aim to identify and distinguish features in the MRI image and the text data of doing the MRI procedure that we collect using deep learning to determine the category of a patient’s Alzheimer's disease level. And for the users to explore with our "Alzheimer's Prediction tool" bar in the navigation area. In the row named "gender", 0.0 indicates male and 1.0 indicates female. Note: In the "Alzheimer's Prediction tool" page, you must click the return button on your browser to come to the previous page </p>
    <p>You can also play with the raw text data by clicking the "Raw Text Data". If you click on the row, you can do sort by this row. If you click the right side of each row, you can search the data you want and finally export the data you want as an excel file by clicking the "Export to excel" button.</p>
    <p>You can have a clear understanding of the MRI image of patients of Alzheimer's and non-patients by clicking "Explore raw image data" and then click the arrow signs or 8 buttons down the center. </p>

    <b>Project Introduction:</b>
    <p>Alzheimer’s disease is a brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks. In most people with the disease — those with the late-onset type symptoms first appear in their mid-60s. Early-onset Alzheimer’s shows between a person’s 30s and mid-60s and is very rare. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia among older adults.</p>
    <p>We want to address the importance of this seeming distant disease because we might have grandparents around the age of 70. And while they do health check annually, the MRI image can be difficult to read. So we have our image system to compare and see the MRI image of Demented or Non Demented people to have an early understanding of the potential disease. </p>
